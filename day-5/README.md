This one was also easy. I get a clue in Twitter before I started but anyway, I would notice that the quest is about binary numbers.

In the part 1 I had a first approach: get the row ID, multiplate by 8 and sum the Colum. But I noticed that if I parsed the hole code to binary, I would get the seat ID without the multiplication.

The challenge in the second part was that I didn't have an expected value in the example. So, I developed a simple function to find the value and a tested against the Advent of code website. I failed in my first chance! I had forgotten add one to the found number. Afterward I develop a test case just in case I would want to refactor in the future.
