Why this aproach:

I face with two challenges:
  - iterate over nested arrays in functional programing
  - avoid duplicate code in part 1 and 2

As a result, I wrote a recursive solution which probably is not the better and clean aproach for this problem (2 or 3 nested arrays). But probably is the the better aproach if I would need to iterate with n nested array.
