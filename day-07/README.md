I had a lot of throubles in the part 1 because I didn't develop a recursive solution. In the example there wasn't necesarry and I wanted to keep it simple. But with the real data I needed a recursive solution. So I had to do a lot of unit test for both of the parts.

I had to check the solution for another person and execute it to compare my result and their. In the part 1 I got 16, the rigth code 161, so it wasn't a tiny mistake.
